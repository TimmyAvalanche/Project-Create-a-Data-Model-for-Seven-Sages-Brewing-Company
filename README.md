# Project: Data-Model-for-Seven-Sages-Brewing-Company
This project focuses on Modelling Data with Power BI

**Objective:** The goal of this step is to create a comprehensive report that summarizes the output of the data model for the CFO of Seven Sages Brewing Company. The report will provide insights into sales performance and gross profit metrics, facilitating informed decision-making.

**Key Components:**

**A. The Report Structure:**
Tab 1: Summarizes sales by customer and customer type across quarters.
Tab 2: Provides a summary of gross profit percentages and unit sales by product.

**B. Visualizations:**
Tab 1: Label the tab "Gross Profit and Unit Sales." > Include a table visual displaying:Product Name, % of Unit Sales by Product, % of Gross Profit by Product
Tab 2: A simple table showing the percentage of sales and gross profit by each product.

**C. Executive Summary:** Each tab will feature a brief Executive Summary at the bottom, providing key insights and findings from the data analysis.

**D. Analysis:** Analyze the table data to identify products that may require further review by the sales team, focusing on those generating significantly higher or lower gross profit relative to sales.

> Outcome: The completed report enables the CFO to visualize critical sales and profit metrics, supporting strategic decisions regarding marketing and pricing strategies for the brewing company.
